2018/1/25: Debug done (Hoping no bug in debug)
- Add debug.cpp, provide two macro ASSERT and ASSERT_NOT_REACHED as assertion interface.


2018/1/25: Change log added
- It seems that to keep a change log is good, so I add it.

2018/1/25: Spef done, func added, fix file_reader, merge ok, write change log
- spef test: input net names and check the result by using TEST_SPEF
- Func: string_to_float, `func.h` is included by header.h, so just include `header.h`
- file_reader: add ascii 10 and 13 to unusefull set for windows

2018/1/26: Verilog parser done
- Create an unit_test folder to put those file for unit tests
- Verilog parser is done, including unit test, makefile.
- Some small changes in log format. Now you can pass a additional bool to not printing date.
- A todo list is created.
- Add a rm-based clean command to makefile.

2018/1/26: Create liberty
- Create many work opportunities
- add simple testcase

2018/1/27: Expectation debug structure
- Add a EXPECT macro
- EXPECT(A,B) will trigger assertion fail if A != B, and print error message, nothing happen if A == B.

2018/1/27: Some liberty stuff
- Add EXPECT_NOT for expectation of not equal.
- Add #define DEBUG_MODE_ON, undefine this will completely turn off debug system, without losing any efficiency.

2018/1/27: fix file_reader , liberty parser
- add isprint() to is_useful function, and ASSERT_NOT_REACHED() to next_token
- Liberty parser

2018/1/27: merge two liberty stuffs, add timing type(setup_rising, hold_rising), timing table(fall/rise_constraint)
- check cell lib: use TEST_CELLLIB
- Liberty parser done

2018/1/31: add get function to liberty files
- modify all 'string' in parameter to 'const string&'
- modify data structure of SpefNet's pin_res
- add get function of liberty and spef

2018/2/1: Some util func
- Optimize string_to_float
- Add an util function of verilog, now you can get cell_type by cell_name

2018/2/2: rc tree done
- rc tree done
- show log message(#error, #warning )

2018/2/3: liberty delay done
- add liberty.h
- add get_delay/slew/constraint to timing_arc.cpp
- add get_value to timing_table.cpp

2018/2/4: Building graph building function
- An graph now can be constructed by .v and .lib files. (without any info.)

2018/2/4: modify test_main
- change cell, timing_table debug message
- add get_downstream to rc_tree
- modify test_main for querying testcase

2018/2/5: rctree early, late mode
- add early, late mode to rc_tree

2018/2/5: modify timing_arc timing query
- add some functions to avoid invalid timing query
- can add pin cap to rc_tree for `load` in timing file

1018/2/5: graph construction complete
- Just as the title

2018/2/6: modify graph's build rc_tree
- build rc_tree after new a rctree

2018/2/6: Graph interface
- Add function to set at/rat of primary in/out
- Add in_graph checking

2018/2/7: timer object
- add timer object
- Add some functino in .ops file to Graph

2018/2/7: Dynamic programming fiesta
- Add mode-dependent comparison between at/rat (func.cpp)
- Calculate at/slew function in graph.
- Fix duplicate RCTree.

2018/2/7: test simple
- use `make main` to test simple, then check simple/myoutput

2018/2/8: fix bugs in dfs at/slew
- add_edge: rev_adj
- add_node: rev_adj
- build: add tree->cal() here, but it should be called after read .timing( after `load` )
- modify iterator Transition_Type in for loop(at_dfs, at_update)

2018/2/9: set_load function at graph
- add outpu_load in graph
- at/slew is ok in simple testcase
- modify Transition_Type order in enum.h

2018/2/8:
- What? previous commit at 2/9!? It is 2/8 10:19 right now!?
- Logger now flush its stream after called
- Rat calculation (Bug nest version)
- Add a lot of really useless comment to decorate the code.

2018/2/9: remove root of rc_tree pin capacitance from liberty, pass c17 at/rat/slew/slack
- add testcase to ignore

2018/2/10: add report_timing

2018/2/9: Simple AC and is_clock checking
- Pass simple testcase
- Node now store whether it is clock
